# QuickNicks
Open-source Minecraft nicknames plugin.

Nothing really special, made this per request within 2 hours.

Mini wiki:
/nick <nick> - Sets you a nick.
/nick off - Removes your nick.

Colorcodes are supported.

If you're using a permissions plugin make sure players have the "quicknicks.nick" permission.

DON'T USE ESSENTIALS ALONGSIDE THIS BECAUSE ESSENTIALS WILL OVERRIDE IT, THIS WAS MADE IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DON'T WISH TO USE ESSENTIALS.
