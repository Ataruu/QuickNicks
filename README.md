# QuickNicks
Open-source Minecraft nicknames plugin.

Nothing really special, made this per request within 2 hours, I may update it from time to time if requested or if interest peaks.

# Mini Wiki

Commands:
/nick <nick> - Sets you a nick.
/nick off - Removes your nick.

Colorcodes are supported.

If you're using a permissions plugin make sure players have the "quicknicks.nick" permission.
